## Introduction
I am ZeroXVM, however I would prefer to be referred to as, "Zero".  
If I were to rate myself as a programmer/coder.. I would say that I am simply very good at programming/coding.  
I am pretty good at seeing issues pretty quickly, and I don't need to worry about optimization since I already optimize it as I go.
## Work
- Roblox **_(Lua)_**
  - Empty Baseplate | [Link](https://www.roblox.com/games/3362132792/Empty-Baseplate)
    - It's basically a Script Builder for new people learning Lua to test their code in.
    - This was a collaborative project, I do not own the game, I only volunteered to revamp everything in the game.
  - **_(There would be more if Roblox didn't have such a negative reputation)_**
- Discord **_(JavaScript)_**
  - Core | Decommissioned
    - It was a Discord Bot that would be a game changer, with having powerful moderation and powerful economic functionality, it would practically beat the competition. Obviously there would be more features if it wasn't decommissioned.
- My PC **_(Rest Of The Languages)_**
  - Aeron | TBD(To Be Determined) | **_(Javascript)_**
    - This was gonna be a competent alternative to Discord.
    - It currently centralizes itself around Privacy, and it would not enforce as many rules but only leaving rules that are very significant to protect people on the platform.
    - Your client would be super secure, without having any sort of vulnerabilities that let malicious users grab sensitive information from you from a simple video or image.
    - It would also be a very fast and lightweight app while practically adding on features that would be essential in a communication app between people, while having extra features that would dominate the competition with how sensible and how fair the app would be.
    - You would be practically seeing freedom in this app from how non-strict it is.
  - Arctic-Wind | In Progress | **_(C++)_**
    - This is going to be a powerful alternative to Roblox.
    - While having similarities to Roblox, this app will be significantly faster than Roblox, while having extremely beautiful graphics. It would also have very fair moderation whilst taking appropriate action towards people who actually breaks the rules.
    - Everything would be modern, so censoring text in the chat would be a cakewalk, developers would have their fair days pay, the platform would be safe for all ages, and there would be a very proficient anti-cheat to prevent exploiters, to make the platform better and more safe.
    - It's worth mentioning that everything would be secure, down to storing player's data. Even if a traditional hacker were to grab everyone's data, they wouldn't be able to do anything with it, not even being able to read your data nor modify it.
  - Aphon | TBD(To Be Determined | **_(C++)_**
    - This was a programming language destined to be faster than C++ and every other language.
    - I currently have no plans to be continuing it as of now, as Google has already made one.
## Programming Languages
- C++ **_(Progressing)_**
- C **_(Same as C++)_** тон
- JavaScript **_(Mastered)_**
- Java **_(Planning to forget as it is not a very good language to code in)_**
- Lua **_(Mastered)_**
